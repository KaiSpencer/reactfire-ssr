The following quick start example builds upon the `burrito` example in the [reactfire quick start guide](https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/reactfire/blob/main/docs/quickstart.md).

If you have not done so already, follow those instructions and we will pick up where it leaves off.

## Concepts

Before we start coding, let's review some concepts.

The concept of how we will manage Server Side Rendering (SSR) is based (and heavily inspired ❤️) by the [tanstack query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/guides/ssr) model for SSR.

### Hydration

We will be `Hydrating` the `reactfire` data with pre fetched data which we `dehydrate` from the server.

This simply means we will be using `getServerSideProps` to fetch the data on the server and pass it to `reactfire` as the initial data for queries.

The outcome is that there is no initial loading state for the data on the client, with the data available immediately, to then be updated with `reactfire` as the data changes in firestore.

### Key points to note

- Be careful not to use `firestore` and `firebase-admin` in the wrong place
	- `firestore` is for the client
	- `firebase-admin` is for the server (getServerSideProps)


## Hydrate component

`reactfire-ssr` provides a `Hydrate` component which is responsible for passing through any `dehydrated` data to your nextjs pages.

Add this component to your `_app.tsx` file.

Ensure it is a child of the `FirestoreProvider` component from `reactfire`.

```tsx showLineNumbers {12,14} filename="_app.tsx"
import { Hydrate } from 'reactfire-ssr'
import {getFirestore} from "firebase/firestore";
import {
  FirestoreProvider,
  useFirebaseApp,
} from "reactfire";

 export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
   const sdk = getFirestore(useFirebaseApp());
   return (
     <FirestoreProvider sdk={sdk}>
	   <Hydrate state={pageProps.dehydratedState}>
	     <Component {...pageProps} />
	   </Hydrate>
     </FirestoreProvider>
   )
 }
 ```

## Pre fetching data

Now we need to use `getServerSideProps` to pre-fetch the data from firestore.

Because `getServerSideProps` runs on the server we need to use the `firebase-admin` sdk to access firestore __not__ `firebase`.

First initialize `initReactfireSSR` which is the base object which all exposed methods you need are attached to (this also helps with type hinting).

This function accepts a generic type which you should populate with unique identifiers for each `DocumentReference` and `CollectionReference` you will be using.

We aim to remove the need for this in the future, but for now until we can figure out a better way to do this, this is the best solution.

The unique identifiers can be anything you want, you will pass them to the hooks when you access the data on the client.

<Callout type="warning">
  Only call `initializeReactfireSSR` once in your application. Its a good idea to do this in a separate file and import it where you need it.
</Callout>


```tsx showLineNumbers filename="pages/index.tsx"
import {initializeReactfireSSR} from "reactfire-ssr";

const reactfireSSR =
  initializeReactfireSSR<
    [
      "burritoDocument",
      "tryreactfireCollection",
      "tryreactfireCollectionYummy"
    ]
  >();
```

Use the `dehydrate` method function which is a helper to unwrap a list of `DocumentReference` and `CollectionReference` objects,
pass this as props to the page to make it available to `reactfire-ssr` hooks in your components.

You will notice the keys in the objects passed to `dehydrate` match the unique identifiers you passed to `initializeReactfireSSR`.

```tsx showLineNumbers filename="pages/index.tsx"
import {getFirestore} from "firebase-admin";
import {initializeReactfireSSR} from "reactfire-ssr";
/**
* Ensure you have initialized firebase somewhere,
* see the examples directory in the repository for an example
*/
const firestore = getFirestore()
const reactfireSSR =
  initializeReactfireSSR<
    [
      "burritoDocument",
      "tryreactfireCollection",
      "tryreactfireCollectionYummy"
    ]
  >();

export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const burritoDocRef = firestore
    .doc("tryreactfire/burrito")
    .withConverter(burritoConverterAdmin); // This converter is optional, but it provides better type safety if you provide one
  const tryreactfireCollectionRef = firestore
    .collection("tryreactfire")
    .withConverter(burritoConverterAdmin);

  const tryreactfireCollectionRefYummy = tryreactfireCollectionRef.where(
    "yummy",
    "==",
    true
  );
  const dehydrateData = await reactfireSSR.dehydrate(
    {
      burritoDocument: burritoDocRef,
      burritoDocument2: burritoDocRef,
    },
    {
      tryreactfireCollection: tryreactfireCollectionRef,
      tryreactfireCollectionYummy: tryreactfireCollectionRefYummy,
    }
  );
  return {
    props: dehydrateData,
	/**
	* Or pass other props alongside the dehydrated data
	*/
    // props: { ...dehydrateData, myOtherProp: "goesHere" }
  };
}
```

## Using Pre fetched data

Now we can use the `useHydratedFirestoreDocData` and `useHydratedFirestoreCollectionData` hooks to access the pre-fetched data.

The first argument is the same as the `useFirestoreDocData` and `useFirestoreCollectionData` hooks which these wrap, the second argument is the unique identifier you passed to `initializeReactfireSSR`.

Under the hood these hooks will use the `dehydrated` data if it is available against the unique identifier you passed to the hook.

If it's available, your data will be available instantly on the client without a loading state.

```tsx showLineNumbers filename="pages/index.tsx"
import {reactfireSSR} from "reactfire-ssr";

const firestore = getFirestore()

export async function getServerSideProps() {
  ...
}

export default function Home() {
 const burritoDocRef = doc(
    useFirestore(),
    "tryreactfire",
    "burrito",
  ).withConverter(burritoConverter);
  const collectionRef = collection(useFirestore(), "tryreactfire").withConverter(burritoConverter), // This converter is optional, but it provides better type safety

  const burritoDoc = reactfireSSR.useHydratedFirestoreDocData(burritoDocRef, "burritoDocument");
  const tryreactfireCollection = reactfireSSR.useHydratedFirestoreCollectionData(
    collectionRef, "tryreactfireCollection"
  );

  if (
    burritoDoc.status === "loading" ||
    tryreactfireCollection.status === "loading"
  ) {
    /**
     * We are prefetching the required data on the server, so this scenario
     * should never happen on the client.
     */
    throw new Error("Should not happen!");
  }

  return (
    <p>
      There are {tryreactfireCollection.data.length} document(s) in the
      collection! <br />
      The burrito is {burritoDoc.data.yummy ? "good" : "bad"}!
    </p>
  );
}
```
