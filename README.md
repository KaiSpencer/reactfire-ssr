# Reactfire SSR

This library builds upon [Reactfire](https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/reactfire) to provide server-side rendering support for Firebase.

The aim is to provide hydration support for Firebase data on the client, as well as a way to pre-render Firebase data on the server in the easiest way possible.

## Installation

```bash
npm install reactfire-ssr
```

## Documentation

[Visit the docs](https://reactfire-ssr.vercel.app/) to learn more about how to use this library.
